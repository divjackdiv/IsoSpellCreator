//
This file outlines the future changes to be made to this project in the near future.
The letter following each task indicates the type of modification/implementation :
(A) = Architectural, (E) = Efficiency, (F) = Functionality, (G) = Graphical
Anything starting with "look at" indicates a possible architectural change, the game itself would not be modified by these changes.
//
