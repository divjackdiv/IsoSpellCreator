Done in last iteration
- "close" button when creating spells now functioning
- hovered points are back
- Level creation is made a lot easier through an editor script. We can create tiles automatically at mouse position if there is space. Objects can also automatically be created on tiles. Open the tile creation window, choose a tile or object to spawn and press 't' in the scene to spawn the object.

TO BE DONE
- Change save names to be automated
- make better ai for attacking from a distance
- resize ui spell template
- create a map of the tiles at start
- look at a possible conversion of sceneStateManager functions towards more static functions
- redo/change mainMenu script to be more in tune with the other scripts
- get rid of branch script, as all it's use is within the point
